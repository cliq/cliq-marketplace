description: Create and maintain a local, auto-refreshing browser panel showing implementation phases, optional steps, and current activity. Use when the user asks for a progress panel, dashboard, or status page for a multi-step task, or when updating a panel already in use.

# Implementation progress

Use `scripts/progress.py` next to this skill to maintain a small browser dashboard
while carrying out the user's task. It uses Python 3.8+ and the standard library;
no server, packages, API keys, or agent-specific tools are needed. The page reloads
`progress.js` every two seconds. Progress reflects your updates, not automatic
observation of tools or the repository.

## Locate the script and panel

Resolve `scripts/progress.py` relative to the directory containing **this loaded
SKILL.md**, whether installed by a plugin or as a standalone skill. Use its absolute
path for subsequent calls; do not assume a username, config directory, or shell's
working directory. Below, `P` means that script path and `DIR` means the panel output
directory. Use the available Python 3 command (`python3`, `python`, or `py -3`).

Choose a writable directory outside the repository and installed skill, preferably
the session's scratch directory. Pass the same absolute `--dir` on every call, even
after changing working directories or resuming the conversation. Keep the script
and panel paths in the task's handoff notes when needed. Shell variables in the
examples are shorthand; tool calls may not share a persistent shell.

Without `--dir`, the script uses `PROGRESS_DIR`, then the OS temporary directory
under `implementation-progress/<cwd-name>-<path-hash>`. Use distinct directories
for concurrent tasks in the same project. Have one agent write a given panel;
individual file writes are atomic, but simultaneous read/modify/write commands
can overwrite each other's changes.

## Start or resume

Adapt a handful of coarse phases to the user's actual plan:

```bash
python3 "$P" init --dir "$DIR" --title "Feature implementation" \
  --subtitle "Implementation progress" \
  --phase "Discovery::Understand requirements and existing code" \
  --phase "Implementation::Make the planned changes" \
  --phase "Verification::Run relevant checks and review the result" \
  --now "Reading the requirements" --open
```

The first phase starts `active`; the others start `pending`. Share the printed
`index.html` path with the user. `--open` asks the OS to launch its default browser;
if no browser is available, the command prints a manual-open URI. Do not claim that
the user saw the panel merely because the launch was requested. In a remote or
headless environment, use `show` and explain that the page lives on that machine.

If a panel already exists, inspect it with `show` and use `open` to reopen it.
`init` refuses to overwrite progress unless `--force` is supplied. Use that flag
only when intentionally restarting the task; otherwise choose a new directory.

## Update at milestones

```bash
python3 "$P" now --dir "$DIR" "Running the integration tests"
python3 "$P" phase --dir "$DIR" 1 done
python3 "$P" phase --dir "$DIR" "Implementation" active
python3 "$P" step --dir "$DIR" 2 "Implement the new behavior" done
python3 "$P" step --dir "$DIR" 2 "Check error handling" active
python3 "$P" phase --dir "$DIR" 3 blocked --detail "Waiting for test credentials"
python3 "$P" show --dir "$DIR"
python3 "$P" open --dir "$DIR"
```

Phase selectors are 1-based indices or unique, case-insensitive title prefixes.
States are `pending`, `active`, `done`, and `blocked`. Steps are optional, added or
updated by case-insensitive title, and displayed under non-pending phases. Adding
a step activates a pending phase. Marking a phase done completes its non-blocked
steps; resolve blocked steps before treating the whole phase as complete. Changing
one phase does not automatically activate or complete any other phase.

Update `now` when the activity changes and phase/step states when they actually
change. The footer flags updates older than 20 minutes; do not invent progress to
clear the indicator. On completion, mark the finished phases done and describe the
outcome in `now`. If work stops early, preserve pending/blocked work and record why.

The percentage is a rough, equally weighted phase estimate: done phases count as
one; active phases count their fraction of done steps, or one half when they have
no steps. It is not elapsed time or an ETA.

## Files

The script writes `index.html`, `progress.json`, and `progress.js` to the panel
directory. Use the CLI rather than editing generated files. Keep these runtime
files out of commits unless the user explicitly wants an exported snapshot.
Temporary directories can be cleaned by the OS; use a persistent `--dir` if needed.

Other tools can read `progress.json`: `title`, `subtitle`, `now`, `updated`
(ISO 8601), and `phases[]` with `title`, `detail`, `state`, and `steps[]`
containing `title` and `state`.
